                    You know, I still think about the time you handled me when I was at my worst. 
                    You were there the whole time talking to me, being patient with me, and just being there for me. 
                    You even asked me to join Discord so we could listen to music together.

                    You even played some of my favorite songs, which I thought was really thoughtful and sweet at the time. 
                    I thought you were just being nice to me back then, but I felt so happy when you told me you did it simply because you wanted me to be happy. 
                    I consider it one of the sweetest things anyone has ever done for me; that was definitely the first time I started falling in love.

                    Remember when I said I wanted to surprise you? This is actually part of the surprise. Yes! "part" of it. 
                    I've been meaning to try making one of these websites ever since! I wanted to dedicate this to allow me to express how much I appreciate and love you in a much more quirky and fun way hehehe...

                    I really hope you like it, Hanie. I know it's not much, but I wanted to make something memorable and special just for you. 
                    The other surprise I have in mind is something we both can slowly build upon, a scrapbook of some sort! 
                    You already guessed what it was actually, that's why I had to change our topic LOL. But hey, as long as you love it, and I have fun doing something just for you. That's what's important, right?

                    Arhnie, I just want to say that I love you so much. I know we haven't been together for a long time, but I feel really happy already whenever I'm with you. Both physically and virtually. 
                    I know we have a lot of things to work on, but I just want you to know that I'm willing to work on those things with you. I want to be there for you, and I want to make you happy.

                    I also want you to rely on me as well. I wanna pamper you. I wanna kiss you. I wanna hug you. I wanna do a lot of sweet things with you. 
                    I want you to know that my intentions with you will be concrete, I have no plans on leaving you for anyone else. You are the only girl that I will love exclusively...
